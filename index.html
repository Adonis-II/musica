<!-- CHANGELOG:
Spotify Integration: I mentioned in the project plan that I was going to use the spotify API to insert playlists and songs into my app, However, due to difficuly and time constraint, I decided to step away from using any API and inserted mp3 files in the database instead. I also did not include playlists and instead added a personal library where users can see the songs that they have added from the main page. Therefore, instead of making an app that interacts with spotify, I made a spotify clone where users can insert songs to library and delete songs from library.

Database Tables: I created 3 more tables than I mentioned such as songs, genre and artists and I did not include a spotify table. Instead, I created a userlibrary table that interacts with the songs table and user table.

Jquery Fade out Post: In the Jquery integration plan, I mentioned that I was going to implement an "X" button that will allow users to click to delete a post such as a song or playlist. However, I decided to implement a heart icon that will be used to either insert or delete a song. The fade out animation will remain the same.
